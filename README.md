## Getting started

### Dependencies

The `dialog` package is not mandatory, yet highly recommended.

Dependencies are handled automatically by the [dependencycheck](https://github.com/rosneburgerworks/cathook/blob/master/scripts/dependencycheck) script.

### Downloading

Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/rosneburgerworks/cathook; cd cathook; ./install-all

The `cathook` folder should have been created successfully, containing all source files.

### Loading / Injecting into game process

Run the following command while inside the source folder:

    sudo ./attach

This will inject `libcathook.so` into the `hl2_linux` process.

When injected, the menu can be opened using the `INSERT` key.

## FAQ

### How do I open the menu?
Press <kbd>INSERT</kbd> while focused on the TF2 window.

### Where is my config file saved?
Configuration files are saved inside the `cathook` folder located in your `opt` folder (`/opt/cathook/data`). The config is in human-readable format and can be edited via your text editor of choice.
